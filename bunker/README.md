creating something hopefully better than webauthn...?

licensed under GPL-3.0 or later

## what needs to be done
- secret storage for pkcs#11 pin
- prompt the user before signing anything
- potentially require authentication with a pre-shared secret before allowing an app to sign anything (probably not nessecary for a demo)
- maaayybe get this working as a standalone library?
